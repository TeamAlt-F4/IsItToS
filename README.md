=============================================

Every day, approximately 30 million people watch content from the popular streaming website twitch.tv.
Over 7 million people stream on the site monthly.
A lot of streamers will react to content from streaming sites such as YouTube.
What is allowed to be posted on YouTube differs from the type of content that can be streamed on Twitch.
Many Twitch streamers have been temporarily banned from the platform for accidentally showing inappropriate content to audiences of thousands of people.

IsItTos aims to eliminate this problem for streamers.
By using:

	*	YouTube’s API and 
	*	trusted moderator recommendations, 

We aim to let streamers make a more informed decision before watching a YouTube video on stream.
We plan to use:
	
	=> Google Chrome plugins for our frontend user interface,
	=> Node JS with Express for our server, and 
	=> MariaDB for our databasing solution.
